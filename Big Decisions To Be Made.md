Okay, let's take a step back and think about the architecture. You've hit on a fundamental tension point when integrating custom functionality with a containerized application like SearXNG.

**Current Approach (Separate Backend/Middleware):**

*   **Pros:** Keeps SearXNG relatively untouched, focusing it on web metasearch. Your custom logic for local sources (Obsidian, files, FreshRSS, etc.) is encapsulated in the Python backend. This separation *can* be clean.
*   **Cons:** Introduces complexity:
    *   **Inter-service Communication:** As you've seen, making the Python backend talk reliably to other containers (like FreshRSS) requires correct Docker networking (same network, using service names like `http://freshrss:port`, not `localhost`), API keys, and handling potential failures. This seems to be a major pain point currently.
    *   **Settings Management:** We've worked to unify settings in `app_settings.json`, but there's still a split between what SearXNG uses natively and what your backend uses.
    *   **Deployment/Orchestration:** You need to manage the SearXNG container *and* your backend container.

**Integrating as SearXNG "Engines":**

*   You're right, this doesn't feel like the correct model. SearXNG engines are primarily designed for querying external web APIs following a specific pattern. Adapting local file access or calls to local services like FreshRSS into this model would be a very unnatural fit and likely require heavy modification of SearXNG's engine-loading and query-processing logic. It would probably break SearXNG's core assumptions.

**Forking SearXNG:**

*   **Pros:** Gives you absolute control. You could theoretically bake the logic from `main_routes.py` directly into SearXNG, potentially simplifying the request flow for *some* sources (like local files, if you handle volume mounting carefully).
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Maintenance Burden:** This is the big one. You become responsible for maintaining your fork, merging upstream SearXNG updates (which can be frequent and complex), and resolving conflicts. This is a significant, ongoing effort.
    *   **Complexity Shift:** The complexity doesn't vanish; it just moves *inside* the SearXNG codebase, which you'd need to become intimately familiar with.
    *   **Still Need Inter-Container Calls:** Even if logic for local files or Obsidian (if using the plugin API) moves into the SearXNG fork, you'd *still* need that container to talk to the FreshRSS container over the Docker network to integrate FreshRSS results. Forking doesn't inherently solve the container networking challenge for services that remain separate.

**Recommendation & Path Forward:**

Before making a drastic decision like forking, I strongly suggest focusing on definitively solving the **inter-container communication issues** with the current architecture. The fact that API calls between your backend and FreshRSS are failing points to a potentially solvable configuration problem rather than an insurmountable architectural flaw.

1.  **Diagnose the FreshRSS Call:**
    *   In `../backend/main_routes.py`, add detailed logging around the `requests.get` or equivalent call to the FreshRSS API. Log the *exact* URL being used, any headers/auth being sent, and the *full* error response or exception traceback.
    *   **Crucially:** Ensure the URL uses the FreshRSS container's *service name* as defined in your Docker Compose file (e.g., `http://freshrss:80/api/greader.php/...` or whatever the correct internal host and port are), not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

2.  **Test Network Connectivity:**
    *   Use `docker exec -it <your_backend_container_name_or_id> /bin/sh` (or `/bin/bash`) to get a shell inside your Python backend container.
    *   From inside, try to reach the FreshRSS container:
        *   `ping freshrss` (or the correct service name)
        *   `wget http://freshrss:port/path/to/api` or `curl http://freshrss:port/path/to/api` (using the service name and the *internal* port FreshRSS listens on). Check if you get a valid response or a connection error.

3.  **Review Docker Compose/Networking:**
    *   Ensure both your backend service and the FreshRSS service are defined within the same `docker-compose.yml` and belong to the same Docker network (often a default network is created, but explicit network definition is better).

Solving this communication issue might make the current architecture perfectly workable and avoid the significant overhead of maintaining a SearXNG fork. Let's try and debug that connection first. Could you show me the relevant parts of your `docker-compose.yml` and the Python code in `main_routes.py` that calls the FreshRSS API?
