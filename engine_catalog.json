Returns geographic information (addresses, points of interest (POIs), coordinates, potentially directions) based on Apple's map data. Value Proposition: Offers map search leveraging Apple's data, known for strong privacy focus and tight integration within the Apple ecosystem (less relevant via SearXNG). Data quality can be excellent in certain areas, particularly urban centers with detailed city views. Overlap: Direct competitor to Google Maps (different data, features, privacy policies) and OpenStreetMap (open data source). Distinguishing Factors: Uses Apple's proprietary map data; strong user privacy stance compared to Google. User Choice: Selected by users preferring Apple's map data, valuing its privacy policy, or potentially finding better local data in specific regions compared to alternatives. Suitability: Good for Locational queries (finding places, addresses) and Planning (exploring areas, checking business info). Direct navigation features less applicable via SearXNG. Not suitable for non-geographic search types. Logistics: SearXNG integration likely relies on scraping or undocumented APIs, potentially leading to instability. Longer timeout might reflect API/scraping complexity. Language/Navigability: Map data and interface are localized globally; usable for English speakers worldwide. Nuances: Provides access to a major proprietary mapping dataset distinct from Google or OSM; reliability in SearXNG can be inconsistent."

Suitability: Excellent for specific Informational queries ('what is X in Y currency?') and useful for financial Planning. Completely unsuitable for any other search type (Problem Solving, Instructional, Comparative, Resource Seeking, Locational, Current Awareness broader than rates). Logistics: Requires a configured backend API (e.g., exchangerate-api.com, openexchangerates.org - may need API keys) or potentially scraping a reliable source. Accuracy depends on the freshness of the backend exchange rate data. Interaction is typically via simple structured queries (amount, currency codes) likely parsed by SearXNG. Language/Navigability: Understands standard currency codes (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY etc.) and basic English commands. Nuances: Utility engine providing a direct computed result, not search results."

Returns integrated search results blending web links with content from its own highly popular services: Mapy.cz (maps), Firmy.cz (business directory), Novinky.cz / Seznam Zprávy (news), Email.cz, Sreality.cz (real estate), etc. Uses its own search index optimized for the Czech language. Value Proposition: Offers the most comprehensive access to the Czech internet, tightly integrating search with essential local services and content, deeply tailored to Czech language and user needs. Overlap: Competes with Google Czech Republic. Contrasts significantly with non-Czech engines. Distinguishing Factors: Dominant Czech market share; deep integration with highly popular local services (especially maps and business directory); strong Czech language processing; independent search index. User Choice: The default choice for a majority of internet users in the Czech Republic; indispensable for anyone needing detailed local information, services, or cultural context within the Czech Republic. Suitability: Excellent for virtually all search types *if the context is the Czech Republic*. Useless for global search or non-Czech topics. Logistics: SearXNG scrapes seznam.cz. Interface and results are primarily in Czech, posing a very high language barrier for non-speakers. Nuances: A prime example of a successful regional search engine/portal deeply embedded in the national digital infrastructure, offering far more than just web links."

Distinguishing Factors: Meta-search capability (queries others); emphasis on clean UI/speed. User Choice: Selected by users who want to cast a wide net across multiple torrent sources efficiently, potentially finding content missed by a single site search, or preferring its interface. Suitability: Good for Resource Seeking (general torrents). Not relevant for other search types. Logistics: Acts as a frontend; queries multiple backend torrent sites via their APIs or scraping. Its reliability depends on the health and accessibility of both SolidTorrents itself and the sites it queries. Longer timeout (4s) might account for querying multiple backends.

    "rag_context": "Engine Type: Specialized Image Search (Reverse Image Search). Primary Use Case: Informational (image origin/usage), Resource Seeking (higher-res versions), Problem Solving (identifying fakes/sources), Comparative (image modifications). Performs reverse image search: takes an image (via URL or potentially upload if SearXNG supports it) as input and searches its index to find web pages where the same or visually similar images appear. Returns links to matching pages, often highlighting modifications or different resolutions found. Value Proposition: A powerful, dedicated tool for tracing the origin and usage of an image online. Can uncover sources, detect plagiarism or misuse, find higher quality versions, and identify manipulated images. Uses its own specialized image index. Overlap: Competes directly with Google Reverse Image Search (integrated into Google Lens), Bing Visual Search, and Yandex Images reverse search. Distinguishing Factors: Sole focus on reverse image search; maintains its own large index specifically optimized for this task; sometimes finds matches missed by general search engines; offers browser extensions and API for commercial use. User Choice: Selected when needing to perform a dedicated reverse image lookup, often chosen for its specific focus and potentially different/better results compared to integrated features in general search engines. Suitability: Excellent for Informational queries about an image's history, Resource Seeking higher resolutions/original sources, Problem Solving related to image verification/authenticity, and Comparative analysis of image modifications. Utterly useless for keyword-based image search. Logistics: Requires image URL input or SearXNG to handle image upload/proxying to TinEye.

Suitability: Can be used for Current Awareness and Informational news queries, but the scope, timeliness, and depth of source coverage might be less comprehensive than major aggregators due to the index being newer/smaller. Not suitable for non-news search. Logistics: SearXNG scrapes yep.com/news. Interface is English. Nuances: Offers news aggregation derived from an independent index, providing an alternative viewpoint in the news discovery landscape."

    "description": "The world's largest online video sharing and social media platform, owned by Google. Users can upload, watch, share, comment on, and subscribe to videos covering a vast range of topics, from entertainment and music to education and news. It also functions as a major search engine for video content.",
    "rag_context": "Engine Type: Video Platform Search (Dominant Global). Primary Use Case: Entertainment, Instructional, Informational, Resource Seeking (videos/music), Current Awareness (news clips/updates). Searches the YouTube platform (youtube.com), the world's largest video repository. Interacts via scraping (challenging) or potentially limited official API use (requires key, quotas apply). Returns links/previews for videos covering nearly every conceivable topic, including music videos, tutorials, vlogs, news clips, documentaries, movie trailers, user-generated content, etc. Value Proposition: Access to the largest and most diverse collection of online video content globally. The default platform for most video uploads and consumption. Overlap: Competes with Vimeo, Dailymotion (much smaller scale). Aggregated by Google Videos, Bing Videos, DuckDuckGo Videos, Qwant Videos. Privacy-focused frontends like Invidious/Piped access its content. Distinguishing Factors: Unmatched scale and content diversity; owned by Google (results influenced by Google algorithms); strong recommendation engine (on YouTube site); hosts vast amounts of music content (official and UGC). User Choice: The default platform for almost any video search due to its unparalleled library size and breadth of topics. Suitability: Excellent for virtually all video-centric search types: Entertainment, Instructional, Informational, Resource Seeking (specific videos/channels/music), Current Awareness. Not suitable for non-video searches. Logistics: Scraping YouTube is notoriously difficult due to Google's anti-abuse measures; reliability via SearXNG's scraping engines can be highly inconsistent. Using privacy frontends (Invidious/Piped engines) is often more reliable. Official API has strict quotas. Interface adapts globally. Nuances: The dominant force in online video, making it indispensable but also subject to Google's algorithms, content policies, and access challenges for third-party tools."

    "description": "A large-scale shadow library project providing access to a massive collection of journal articles, academic texts, and general-interest books, often without explicit permission from copyright holders. It operates through various domains and access methods due to legal challenges.",
    "rag_context": "Engine Type: Shadow Library Search Engine. Primary Use Case: Resource Seeking (documents). Searches the Z-Library shadow library network via its various access points (official website requiring login, Telegram bots, potentially mirrors - exact method depends on SearXNG engine implementation). Returns metadata and direct download links for a massive collection of books (fiction, non-fiction, textbooks) and academic articles. Value Proposition: Provides free access to a very large collection of digital texts, including many recent books and paywalled articles, often considered one of the most comprehensive shadow libraries alongside LibGen. Overlap: Significant overlap with Library Genesis (LibGen) and Anna's Archive (which indexes both). Contrasts sharply with legal sources (publisher sites, ebook stores, libraries). Distinguishing Factors: Historically known for a large collection of general interest e-books in addition to academic content; access methods often involve logins, specific domains, or bots due to frequent takedowns. User Choice: Selected by users seeking specific books (especially newer releases) or articles they cannot access legally or find on other shadow libraries. Suitability: Excellent for Resource Seeking (hard-to-find books/papers). Unsuitable for general file search, queries requiring copyright compliance, or most other search types. Logistics: Requires SearXNG admin to configure working access points (website, potentially bot interactions, or reliable mirrors - these change constantly due to legal pressure). Access often requires user login on the Z-Lib site itself, which complicates direct SearXNG integration. High timeout (7s) reflects potential network instability and complexity. Interface often English/Russian, content multi-lingual. Nuances: Operates outside copyright law; access is frequently disrupted and requires users/admins to find current working methods; usage carries legal risks in some jurisdictions."
